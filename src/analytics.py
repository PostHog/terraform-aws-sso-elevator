"""PostHog analytics integration for SSO Elevator.

This module provides optional analytics tracking when a PostHog API key is configured.
All events include a global "application" property for filtering.

Usage:
    import analytics

    analytics.capture(
        event="aws_access_requested",
        distinct_id=requester.email,
        properties={"account_id": "123456789012", ...}
    )

    # Call shutdown before Lambda freeze to flush events
    analytics.shutdown()
